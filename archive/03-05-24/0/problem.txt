Problem 1: New York Stock Exchange

The New York Stock Exchange has a problem. An especially avid stock enjoyer was making trades so fast that their system was overloaded, and they couldn't figure out the total number of stocks in the account of this trader. Fortunately, they knew that there was a programming competition going on at <unnamed school>, and they used this as an opportunity to get help. They know the total number of trades made by the trader, $n$, and the number of stocks bought or sold in each trade, and need your help to find the change in the number of stocks overall.

Your program should take as input an integer $n$, followed by $n$ lines each containing a whole number - the number of stocks bought in a given trade, or a negative number if they were sold. Output the sum of all these whole numbers - the overall change in the number of stocks. <em>Your program should not output anything else, including any prompts for user input</em>.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
5
1
2
3
4
-10
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
0
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $0 < n \leq 2000$, and that the sum of the given numbers will not exceed $10^{12}$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
The first line, 5, indicates that 5 trades were made and so 5 values are to be provided. Then, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + (-10) = 0$.
