Problem 5: Save the World

For the first time in recorded history, a message from intelligent extraterrestrial civilisation has reached Earth. The task aims to assess human intelligence - if we pass the test, we can join forces with the aliens; otherwise, we will be eviscerated by a high-energy laser beam. The UN Secretary General, tasked with finding the brightest minds on earth, was literally overcome with joy to discover that there was a programming competition going on at <unnamed school>, and has decided to delegate the task to you.

Your program will input a single positive whole number $n$. To pass the test, you must output the sum of the number's <em>unique</em> digits, <em>not including multiple occurrences of the same number</em>.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
72389173
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
30
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $n \leq 10^100$.  Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
The unique digits are 7, 2, 3, 8, 9 and 1.  The sum of these digits is 30, so this is the answer.
