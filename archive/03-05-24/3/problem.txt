Problem 4: Triangle Fans

The <unnamed school> maths department are holding a contest for best right triangle - for obvious reasons, only right triangles with all integer lengths are allowed to be submitted. However, in a shocking effort from the Guild of Non-Right Triangle Enjoyers, a slew of submissions have arrived at the maths office which are not actually right triangles - far too many for the teachers to go through them all to see which ones are genuine. Thus, they wish to employ your services in determining which are actually right (in both senses of the word).

Given three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ on different lines, determine whether the triangle with sides of these lengths is right-angled. If it is, output "True" (no quotes) - if the triangle is not right-angled or a triangle cannot be made from the given side lengths, output "False" (again no quotes).

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
15
8
17
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
True
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that the three numbers will all be less than $10^6$.  Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
No explanation for this one, but it should hopefully be clear from a diagram.
