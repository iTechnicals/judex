Problem 7: A Probable Sequence of Events

In a probable sequence of events, the Flying Spaghetti Monster has granted one lucky(?) <unnamed school> student the ability to foresee the future. However, the monster has also hacked into the student's eToro account so that he can only make two trades in the remainder of his life - one buy, one sell. With the student's new powers, he has determined the future prices of a stock of his choice, and would like to know when he should buy and when he should sell to fulfil a few conditions. For reasons that are difficult to understand, if the stock price ever decreases while the student holds the stock, he will spontaneously combust, and this is generally regarded as something to avoid. Furthermore, the student is a big believer in brand loyalty, and would rather hold the stock for as long as possible, even if this is less profitable - although, if there are two periods of equal length over which he could hold the stock, he will choose the most profitable. The last thing the Spaghetti Monster did was to cripple the student's mathematical abilities, so he can no longer himself determine when to buy and sell - thus, he has reached out to you for help.

Input a list of $n$ positive whole numbers on different lines. The last line of input will be -1, indicating that there are no more numbers. Find the longest unbroken substring of numbers in the given list such that every number is <em>strictly</em> larger than its predecessor (they cannot be equal) - output the length of this substring and the sum of the numbers it contains on the same line, with a space in between. If there are two increasing substrings of equal length, output the data corresponding to the one with the largest sum.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
4
5
3
7
10
12
12
-1
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
4 32
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $n \leq 10^5$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
The longest substring of numbers that are increasing is 3, 7, 10, 12, with a length of 4. The sum of these numbers is 32. Note that the substring 3, 7, 10, 12, 12 is not increasing, as the last two numbers are equal - also, the substring 4, 5, 7, 10, 12 is invalid, as it is broken by the number 3.
