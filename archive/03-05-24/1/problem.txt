Problem 2: 2-Simplex

'Simplex' is a fun word, and it actually has a fun meaning as well. It is almost not relevant whatsoever to this question.

Your program should take as input an integer $n$, followed by $n$ lines each containing a whole number. For each of these $n$ numbers, output the sum of all the positive whole numbers from 1 to the number in question. Again, <em>your program should not output anything else, including any prompts for user input</em>.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
3
1
2
3
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
1
3
6
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $n \leq 2000$, and that the sum of all the numbers provided will not exceed $10^6$.  Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
The first line is 3, indicating that there are 3 subsequent lines of input. Then,
$1 = 1$
$1 + 2 = 3$
$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$
