Problem 3: Grassed Up

At the <unnamed school> estates department, lots of hard work is done to ensure that the school is kept in good condition. One of their most recent projects involves the establishment of large grass squares around the school site, with whole number edge lengths. However, some students, wishing to steal grass for their own evil purposes, are submitting fake requests for grass to be laid. Fortunately, these students are not very numerically gifted, and they request grass squares with a random area each time, while true grass enjoyers only submit requests for amounts of grass that are actually square numbers.

Your task is to write a program that, given a grass order, determines whether it is a square number, and so whether or not it is potentially fraudulent. Your program should take as input an integer $n$. If $n$ is the square of a whole number, output "YES" (no quotes) - otherwise, output "NO".

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
16
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
YES
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $n \leq 2^{63}-1$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
$16 = 4^2$.
