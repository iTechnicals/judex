Problem 6: Mathematics Contest

Jamie is a contestant in a maths competition, and has come across an unusual question involving Fibonacci numbers, described below. He has turned to you for help. Do not invoke his wrath.

It is known that every integer $m$ has a multiple which is a Fibonacci number. Given an integer $n$, input $n$ lines, each containing an integer $m$ - for each $m$, output the smallest <em>positive</em> integer $k_m$ such that $mk_m$ is a Fibonacci number.

As a reminder, if we denote the $n^\text{th}$ Fibonacci number as $F_n$, then the Fibonacci numbers are defined by $F_0 = F_1 = 1$ and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. For example, $F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 1 + 1 = 2$, $F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$, $F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 3 + 2 = 5$, and so on.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
5
1
2
3
4
5
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
1
1
1
2
1
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that the sum of all the solutions will be at most $10^{15}$.  Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
$1$, $2$, $3$ and $5$ are themselves Fibonacci numbers so the smallest $k_m$ is just 1. $4$ is not a Fibonacci number, but $8$ is, and $4 * 2 = 8$ - clearly there are no smaller values of $k_m$ that work.
