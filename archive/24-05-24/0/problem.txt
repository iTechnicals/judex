Your program should input 3 whole numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ on 3 separate lines, which are the dimensions of a cuboidal box from Bobby's Box Emporium, the premier seller of boxes in the local galactic supercluster. You should output the volume of the box.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
71
35
21
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
52185
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $x, y, z, xyz < 2^{63}$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
A cuboidal box with side lengths 71, 35 and 21 has volume 52185.
