Problem 5: The Power of Tower

Your program should input an integer $n$, and determine whether $n$ can be written in the form $a^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers greater than or equal to 2. If so, output "True" (no quotes) - othwerwise, output "False" (no quotes). It is not necessary to output the actual values of $a$ and $b$.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
625
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
True
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that $n < 2^{32}$.  Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
$625 = 5^{4}$.
