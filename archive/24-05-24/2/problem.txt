Problem 3: The Bad Old Days II

As previously, this question concerns the pre-decimal UK monetary system. One pound contains 20 shillings, and each shilling is equivalent to 12 pence.

Your program should input one line containing an integer, some number of pence. You should output this quantity in pounds, shillings and pence in the format £X Ys Zd, where $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are the number of pounds, shillings and pence respectively. You must make sure that your output uses the fewest coins possible - in other words, there must be fewer than 20 shillings and fewer than 12 pence in the output.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
13394
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
£55 16s 2d
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that the number of pence is strictly less than $2^{16}$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
13394 pence is equivalent to 55 pounds, 16 shillings and 2 pence. It's not possible to make this quantity with any fewer coins.
