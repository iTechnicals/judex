Problem 2: The Bad Old Days I

Back in the bad old days, UK money wasn't simple like it is today. Instead of 100 round pence, the pound was divided into 20 shillings, and each shilling was divided into 12 pence. Nowadays, this is called the pre-decimal system. Back then, it was called the system.

Your program should input 3 lines, each containing an integer - a number of pounds, shillings and pence. You should output one integer - the number of pence that this quantity of currency is equivalent to.

<strong>Example Input</strong>
```
55
16
2
```
<strong>Example Output</strong>
```
13394
```
<strong>Constraints</strong>
You are guaranteed that the number of pence in the solution is less than $2^{63}$. Your program must complete within 1 second, and use no more than 64MB of memory.

<strong>Explanation</strong>
55 shillings is equivalent to $55 * 20 = 1100$ shillings, with an additional 16 for a total of 1116. Then, 1116 shillings is equivalent to $1116 * 12 = 13392$ pence, with an additional 2 for a total of 13394.
