# judex

A simple and insecure Linux judging server for competitive programming, made in Python (Flask), and supporting Python and C++ submissions.

The server is designed for strictly sequential competition formats, where question _i_ must be solved before question _i+1_ can be attempted.

The server is intended to be run as a Docker container.
